  The renderer now receives configuration data purely through the `RenderState` struct, enforcing strict module separation as specified in CLAUDE.md.

## Iteration 1
- Start: 16:43:18Z | End: 16:46:16Z
- Output (last 3 lines):
  - Committed as: `feat(ui): expand interaction radius slider ranges` (commit 6303b12)
  
  The next unchecked task is **Task 3: Smooth population graph Y-scale**.

## Iteration 2
- Start: 16:44:57Z | End: 16:46:31Z
- Output (last 3 lines):
  **Next task:** Smooth population graph Y-scale (task 3)
  
  The slider ranges now allow users to experiment with much wider interaction radii (from as low as 5 pixels up to 200 pixels), enabling better exploration of boid behavior dynamics.
