## Iteration 1
- Start: 15:33:04Z | End: 15:36:10Z
- Output (last 3 lines):
  - ✅ Commit successful
  
  The next unchecked task is the **Sex system** (Male/Female tags with reproduction requirements).

## Iteration 2
- Start: 15:36:14Z | End: 15:38:29Z
- Output (last 3 lines):
  - ✅ Committed with descriptive message (commit `ac90f8c`)
  
  The sex system is now fully functional. Boids will only reproduce when they encounter an opposite-sex partner of the same swarm type within interaction radius, with both partners off cooldown.

## Iteration 3
- Start: 15:38:33Z | End: 15:41:14Z
- Output (last 3 lines):
  5. **Commit**: `feat(sim): implement antivax boid repulsion system` (commit 0a52cd0)
  
  The implementation follows all guardrails: uses spatial grid for neighbor queries, forces are additive to flocking, parameters stored in SimConfig, and the existing cure mechanism remains functional for antivax boids.

## Iteration 4
- Start: 15:41:18Z | End: 15:47:34Z
- Output (last 3 lines):
  - ✅ Committed with descriptive message (cebd9b8)
  
  The next unchecked task in the requirements is **Pause/Reset controls**.
