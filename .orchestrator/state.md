# Orchestrator State
<!-- SINGLE mutable state. Read at cycle start (auto-loaded via CLAUDE.md @import). -->
<!-- Update before /compact or session end. -->
<!-- Sibling files: plan.md (mission), decisions.md (audit trail), mistakes.md (error patterns). -->

## No Urgent Issues ✅

raygui.h build error fixed (commit fa63385). Build clean, all 11 tests pass.

---

## Note-Taking Reminders
<!-- These are your duties every cycle — do not skip. -->
- After every non-trivial choice → append to `.orchestrator/decisions.md` (DEC-NNN format)
- After fixing a worker mistake → append to `.orchestrator/mistakes.md` (worker's table)
- Before spawning a worker → check `.orchestrator/mistakes.md` for that worker's error history
- Before clearing session decisions → promote important ones to `.orchestrator/decisions.md`
- After agents complete tasks → update Active Workers and Jobs Complete tables below

## Current Phase

**Phase 10 — Behavior Rules — COMPLETE ✅**

**Next action:** Begin Phase 11 (Extensions via Ralph Loop). See plan.md § Phase 11.

---

## Phase Progress

### Phases 1–7: Setup & Infrastructure ✅
All manual setup, scaffolding, orchestrator state, CLAUDE.md hierarchy, agent definitions, changelog hooks, build system, and shared API headers — complete.

### Phase 8: Parallel Module Development ✅
Three worktree workers built core modules in parallel (1,123 lines total):
- ECS core — FLECS world, systems pipeline, spawn logic, stats tracking
- Spatial grid — Fixed-cell hash grid, 11 passing tests, 33ms for 10k entities
- Renderer — Full Raylib pipeline with raygui stats overlay
- Branches merged to main in dependency order (spatial → ecs → render)

### Phase 9: Integration & Wiring ✅
Single integration worker connected all modules:
- Main simulation loop — FLECS world + Raylib window integrated
- Spatial grid wiring — ECS systems rebuild grid every frame
- Rendering wiring — ECS sync feeds boid positions to renderer
- Flocking behavior — 210 boids (200 Normal + 10 Doctor), cohesion/alignment/separation
- Stats overlay — Real-time population counts via raygui panel
- Build: 11M binary, all 11 tests pass, 60 FPS steady, no memory leaks
- Key commits: db71f56 (integration), a54a21e (SpatialGrid crash fix), 00a2118 (debug cleanup)

### Phase 10: Behavior Rules — COMPLETE ✅
Single worker (Option A, DEC-013) implemented all rules in one commit (c0a3aef, 516 lines):
- Aging — Health.age and InfectionState.time_infected incremented per frame
- Death — time_infected >= t_death removes Alive tag, updates dead counters
- Infection — same-swarm only, p_infect probability, spatial grid neighbor queries
- Cure — doctors cure ANY infected boid (cross-swarm), p_cure probability
- Reproduction — same-swarm, offspring from N(mean,stddev), cooldown, deferred spawning
- Promotion — Normal boid age >= t_adult, p_become_doctor per frame
- Stats — cumulative death/newborn counters, per-frame alive recounting
- 13 new files in src/sim/, systems.cpp filled in, stats.cpp updated
- Build clean, all 11 tests pass, simulation runs at 60 FPS

### Phase 11: Extensions via Ralph Loop — FUTURE
Depends on Phase 10 completion. Six extensions defined in plan.md.

## Session Decisions
<!-- Scratch space for this session. Promote to decisions.md before session end. -->

- DEC-012: raygui fix — CPM dependency added, hacky include path replaced (fa63385)
- DEC-013: Phase 10 Option A chosen — single worker, sequential implementation
- Phase 10 complete (c0a3aef) — code review pending
